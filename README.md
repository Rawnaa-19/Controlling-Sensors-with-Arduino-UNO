## Introduction
The third task for the Electronics and Power Department is controlling some sensors with an Arduino UNO. A sensor is an input device that produces an output in response to its surrounding environment.Detecting an object in the back of a vehicle, monitoring a patient's heart rate, and using smoke detectors are just some of the many applications for sensors,which can be classified into two types: analog and digital.**(Teja, 2023)** Analog sensors measure a continuous range and the output is a continuous signal represented by a sine wave, while digital sensors measure discrete values and the output is a discrete signal represented by a square wave. (Teja, 2023)

## Ultrasonic Sensor
Ultrasonic sensor is an electrical device that measures the distance to an object by sending an ultrasonic sound waves. It calculates the distance by using this formula D = Â½ T x C, the T here refers to time that the ultrasonic sound takes untill it reaches an object,and the C is the speed of sound.(Robocraze, 2022)
The ultrasonic sensor has 4 pins (Vcc , ground, trigger,and echo pin).The trigger pin is the input pin that triggers "initiates" the sensor by sending the sound waves to detect an object.And the echo pin is the output pin that recieves the sound wave and send a signal back if an object is detected  (Robocraze, 2022)
